## Research Problem
- Running is one of the exercises with a low barrier to entry.
    
    Also, it can be carried out easily **without restrictions on time and place.**
    
- Contrary to this accessibility, exercising with an **unsuitable running posture can negatively affect your health.**
- There is **little running gait monitoring application** for runners.



## Research Novelty

1. **Cost Effective**
    - Most of the previous research related to the Running Gait analysis was conducted **using Motion capture.**
    - Unlike the high-cost previous method, we would like to conduct research using a sensor with **inexpensive** and **similar accuracy to** motion capture.
    
2. **Without environmental constraints**
    - Studies we've mentioned had limitations in conducting experiments indoors.
    - In this study, all the experiments are conducted against the background of the actual running environment.
    
3. **Prevent injuries**
    - Through the monitoring screen that analyzed the running gait, this application shows the user's strike style.
    - Each strike style can impact certain body parts, based on this, the user can find a running style that suits their health.
